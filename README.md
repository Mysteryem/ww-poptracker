3. There are boxes all over the map of varying colors, they represent the following: 
    Green - Can get
    Red - Can't get
    Orange - Can get some items in a given area but not all of them
    Blue - Can see item but can't get (tracker does not account for these yet)
    Yellow - Can reach by breaking logic (tracker does not account for these yet)
